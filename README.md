# dAIgnosis

Moved by the plight of families battling rare diseases in their children, we created dAIgonstic to simplify and speed up the diagnosis process with the power of AI. 
dAIgonstic employs machine learning to help doctors quickly pinpoint rare diseases in children from clinical data, aiming to start treatment sooner.
## How we built it
With a lot of care and magic. Using Python, Cypher to query the Neo4j DB and ML models to classify the disease probability and the disease type.
## How to run:
Run python3 classifier.py and then for each task, the respective CSV files will be generated.
